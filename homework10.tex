  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{11.15 (40 points)} Find the angle $\theta_{max}$ at which the maximum radiation is emitted, in
    Ex. 11.3 (Fig. $11.13$). Show that for ultrarelativistic speeds (v close to c), $\theta_{max} \approxeq \sqrt{(1-\beta)/2}$. 
    What is the intensity of the radiation in this maximal direction (in the ultrarelativistic case), in proportion 
    to the same quantity for a particle instantaneously at rest? Give your answer in terms of $\gamma$.
    \emph{Note that this is for on-axis radiation (i.e. Bremstrahlung) which is a bit different from the example we 
    did in class.  Start with Eq. 11.74 in Griffiths, and proceed as we did in class to calculate the emitted intensity.}

    \item \textbf{12.9 (20 points)} A Lincoln Continental is twice as long as a $VW$ Beetle, when they
    are at rest. As the Continental overtakes the $VW$, going through a speed trap, a
    (stationary) policeman observes that they both have the same length. The $VW$ is
    going at half the speed of light. How fast is the Lincoln going? (Leave your answer
    as a multiple of $c$.)

    \item \textbf{12.10 (20 points)} A sailboat is manufactured so that the mast leans at an angle $\bar{\theta}$ with
    respect to the deck. An observer standing on a dock sees the boat go by at speed $v$
    (Fig. $12.14$). What angle does this observer say the mast makes?
    \emph{Note that length contraction can help us understand why synchrotron radiation comes out in the 
    forward direction when going from the particle's frame to the observer frame.}
